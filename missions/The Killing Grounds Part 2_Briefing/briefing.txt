 The last Soviet RORSAT made a pass within range of the fleet. The Soviets will move to strike, either <LineBreak/>with their remaining bombers or their submarines. After the cruise missile attacks by American <LineBreak/>submarines, intelligence staff believe that fewer than 50 Backfires are mission capable, but the <LineBreak/>Soviets still have plenty of Badgers, and their AS-6 Kingfish are almost as deadly as the Backfire's <LineBreak/>AS-4 Kitchens. The Independence battlegroup is currently west of Keflavik, with two Aegis cruisers <LineBreak/>in attendance along with a ring of anti-air and anti-submarine escorts. The amphibious group is <LineBreak/>anchored off Stykkisholmur with another Aegis cruiser and a half dozen other escorts. Iowa's group <LineBreak/>is moving southwest to rejoin the Independence group after bombarding Hvalfjordur with missile <LineBreak/>cruisers in escort. To protect the fleet, the U.S. Air Force has an E-3A operating out of Sonderstrom <LineBreak/>Air Force Base in Greenland, monitoring the Denmark Strait, while an Army air defence site has been <LineBreak/>established north of Skagastr√∂nd. The fleet's own E-2C Hawkeyes are also in the air. To ensure the <LineBreak/>success of the invasion, Nassau and Tarawa must both survive. After retaking Iceland, the <LineBreak/>Independence battlegroup will move to attack the Kola Peninsula, and all three carriers and two of <LineBreak/>the three Aegis cruisers must survive for the attack to go through.
